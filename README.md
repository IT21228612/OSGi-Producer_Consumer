### Assignment 01 : Micro-kernel Architecture
### Objective :
The objective of this assignment is to check students’ knowledge regarding OSGi framework and its underlying architecture. As well service intercommunication in OSGi Framework, registering services and lifecycle implementation of OSGi bundles.

### Guidelines:
A. Assignment is an open-ended assignment. Creativity is up to you to decide.<br>
B.This is similar to the practical example given in Apache Equinox Lab practical. You have to develop your own publisher-subscriber scenario.<br>
C.You can use Apache Equinox OSGi framework or any OSGi framework for the deployment. (Use Eclipse IDE for the implementation)<br>
D.Marks will be allocated for given deliverables, and marking scheme is given below.<br>
E.You will be given deadline on 14th of March 2024 (Late submissions are not accepted; 50% marks will be decreased from overall marks any delay or the failure to conduct Viva) <br>
F.The group should represent maximum of 4 members.<br>
### Question:
You should implement the Producer – Consumer scenario using OSGi framework. You have to implement separate service bundle (or bundles) as producer (or producers) and to consume that service (or services), there should be a consumer bundle (or bundles). You should establish service communication among producer and consumer.
Each member should implement producers and consumers. If a member created and handled complex situations according to the implementation nature and the complexity additional marks will be offered under the complexity category of the scenario.
